# White_Wine_Quality_Analysis-Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis on White Wine Quality Using Python

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a set of data for white wine. The set contained various chemical properties of the wine (e.g. pH, alcohol percentage, density etc.) and also an expert-judged quality measure for each wine, on a scale from 1 (poor) to 10 (outstanding). The R programming language was used to conduct the analysis.

# Additional Documents

white.csv - the raw data containing the 11 chemical property measurements and single quality score for a 4,898 different white wines.



# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- The process of analyzing the data, discovering the patterns, spotting anomalies, testing hypotheses, and checking the assumption. We use summary statistics and graphical  representations for the EDA.


- Project Objective

Study the data set of white wine quality. The objective of the study is to conduct EDA on several parameters of the data set.
